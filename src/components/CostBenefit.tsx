          Estimating the monetary value of pre-screening for cancer requires a multifaceted approach that considers both
          direct and indirect cost implications. At the direct level, savings emerge from differences in treatment costs
          between early and late-stage diagnoses. Early detection often means less aggressive and thus less expensive
          treatments, potentially saving thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars per individual. Beyond
          treatment, early-stage diagnoses can result in shorter hospital stays or even outpatient procedures, leading
          to further direct cost savings. Indirectly, the value extends to the preservation or minimal disruption of a
          patient's earning capacity. Detecting cancer early can reduce treatment time, allowing individuals to return
          to work faster and contribute to the economy. Additionally, societal savings come into play when considering
          the broader healthcare systemâ€”fewer resource-intensive treatments mean reduced strain on medical facilities
          and staff. It's also important to acknowledge the harder-to-quantify value derived from an individual's
          improved quality of life, the potential decrease in family caregiving needs, and the emotional wellbeing of
          patients and their families, which, while not directly translatable to a dollar amount, undeniably carry
          significant worth.
